## SCENE 1

|------------------|
| SCHOOL           | - initially dark
|------------------|
| STARTUP OFFICE   | - action starts here
|------------------|
     AUDIENCE

--Play opens in a modern, chic, and busy silicon valley-type office. All around are people typing away at their laptops and having friendly conversation. Happy, "productivity-enhancing" muzak plays.

--CEO (Richard) enters with a macbook under one arm and a phone in the other. He shakes hands with an important-looking fellow, who is an influential investor.
R: Hi Mike! Great to see you here this fine morning. How are you?
M: Very well indeed.
R: Great to hear! Let's cut to the chase here - Click Co is doing better than ever. Over the last trimester Click Co has grown 300% - our user base is up to a record high of 3 Million, and our profits have followed suit. 2019 is shaping up to be the most profitable fiscal year on record! All we need to grow even more is your support.
M: For sure Richard, I've always believed in your company. How are the user base demographics looking?
R: Fairly consistent - our decision to narrow our focus on the young adult market has proven to be a great gamble, and is the primary driver for our engagement. Advertisers love it!
M: Lovely! You can count on my support.
R: Awesome! Take care Mike!

--Mike promptly leaves the stage. One designer in a hawaiian shirt runs up to Richard.
D: Hey Richard, great to see you this morning. You about the results of our design AB testing.
R: Yep.
D: It looks like Jeff was right - bright colors and excessive animations do drive engagement. V2, which includes an overhaul of the interaction screen, is set to roll out next week.
R: Good news - push it prod asap! I promised Mike a growth in screen time, please make sure this delivers.
D: I'll follow up over slack.

--Mike is about to leave, but an engineer exec catches him by the arm.
E: Hey Mike, one idea I had last night - what if start paying people for their data? Like, explicitly. We could create a "research" vpn or something and then pay people to use it.
M: Honestly, why not? What could possibly go wrong?


## Scene 2

--Dramatic scene change: the cheery muzak stops, lights go out, and all startup members stop moving, all at once. Instead, an eerie and very ambient tune starts playing, and the spotlight falls on Stephan in the SCHOOL part of the stage.
--In he SCHOOL students, arranged in an ellipse, sit on various blocks and other furniture and stare into phones. The phones cast a ghostly light onto their faces.

--Stephan cautiously walks to the center, clearly uncomfortable and a little scared.

S: Hi... I'm new here...But I'm really excited to meet all of you! Can someone, like, show me around or something?

--Nobody reacts. Instead, a phone is lowered from the catwalk, screen on.
--Stunned and a little scared, he looks into it. Instantly, a loud stream of noise erupts from the speakers. This noise is a combination of "social media sounds" (a like, a tweet, etc), and pleasant sounds from commercials (a pepsi can opening, a party, etc).
--Scared even more, he quickly puts the phone down, looks around, and cautiously picks it back up. The noise erupts once more. He shudders, and exits.*


## Scene 3
|------------------|
| SCHOOL           |
| CAFETERIA        |
|                  |
|----CURTAIN-------|
|                  | - action starts here
|------------------|
     AUDIENCE

--Curtain closes. Mike comes out one end. Richard quickly emerges from in-between the curtains, clearly hurried and agitated. Upon seeing Mike, he fakes a smile.

R: Hey Mike, I got your email - I don't think you should worry.
M: And I got your data - engagement is clearly going down because of this thing. I don't know if you've planned for this scenario, but you have to do something about this game.
R: We can always just up the gamification level in our app - maybe like add a number to relationships or something. That would keep engagement high.
M: It better.


## Scene 4

--Curtains open to a gloomy room with the spotlight on a cafeteria table. There is some food on it. Some people are on their phones, but others are talking.
--As Stephan enters, pairs of students start yelling numbers in ascending order - 6, 20, 100. Finally, two students yell out 300, high five, and go back to their phones.

S: So, I would love to get to know all of you! I'm really bad with names, so maybe you could introduce yourselves.

--One girl who had put down her phone earlier directs her attention to Stephan

M: Hi! You're the transfer kid, right?
S: Yeah.
M: How does Mountain College Prep feel?
S: Can't complain. Although wait - there were so many AP course offerings on that one sheet I got that I almost ran out the door.
M: Welcome to Mountain, kid. This place is brutal, but you come out with a work ethic of steel.


## Scene 5
--Time starts speeding up. Romantic music plays as students leave the table, sit down at the table, and leave again. Only Mary and Stephan remain, Mary slowly gliding off stage, and Stephan standing, enamored.
--Example of music: https://youtu.be/XF46qPRD1WM
--This moment is broken by a CTA announcement - "attention, doors closing...". The students arrange themselves in a horizontal line, and hold on to a railing in the air. Once in a while they all wobble. Everyone stares at their phones. Stephan is among them.
--Stephan looks disoriented at first, then he pulls out his phone and opens facetime (his screen is projected onto the stage). Mary quickly answers while in a well-lit room off-stage, probably the green room.

M: Hey, what's up?
S: The L-train ceiling. Are you doing anything tonight?
--Mary looks genuinely disappointed.
M: Yeah, actually. I have to finish my APUSH reading and god knows what else - sorry! We should definitely hang out another time.
S: Yeah sure, let me know if you need help.

--CTA announces a stop, and everyone exits the car.

|    JUGS/CLOCK     | - jugs with "energy" are in front of the "wall" that separates the rooms
|------CURTAIN------|
|                   | - action starts here
|-------------------|
     AUDIENCE

--Curtains close. Mike emerges once more, his hair all over the place, with huge wet stains around his armpits. The engineer who proposed the VPN comes out from the other side, very fearfully.
M: Bill, *sighs heavily*, you idiot! Apple just suspended all of our internal apps because your stupid VPN blatantly violated the App Store terms of service. Oh, and every ethical norm ever set. Paying our users for their data? Who even thought of that?
B: Didn't you...
--Mike starts pulling out his hair
M: You know what I fucking woke up to? Messages from 30, that's a three and a zero, different employees about their food app not working. Try going through that and then not losing all of your hair. And I have 3 meetings scheduled for today!
--Bill tries to say something
M: Are you deaf? Holy fuck. You must be deaf. Get that shit off the app store, NOW!

--Bill backs away from where he emerged and Mike storms away in-between the curtains.


### Scene 7
--The scene is divided into two, with Stephan's room on the left and Mary's room on the right. Both have a bed and a desk. The stage is dark except for two spotlights on the two rooms and the jugs/clock.
--Stephan is getting ready for bed, and Mary is pacing the room, on her phone. Stage crew in dark uniforms walk up with a clock, two jugs for the floor, and two jugs to pour with. The jugs on the floor represent "mental energy", and they're almost empty. The mental energy liquids have different colors. The stage crew put down the clock, floor jugs, and start to slowly turn the clock.
--After fixing his bed, Stephan lays down and closes his eyes. Instantly, one stage crew starts pouring "mental energy" into the left jug.
--As the clock ticks away, Mary alternates between laying in her bed with her phone, pacing, and typing at her desk. At a certain point she speaks, and then goes back to typing.
M: Oh my god, is that a whole essay? Wha...? This classroom update...!
--At 3AM Mary does go to bed. Stephan's jug filling up signals an end to the night, and the stage crew remove the pouring jugs and the clock. Mary's jug has barely any liquid in it.

|                   | - scene 9
|-------------------|
     AUDIENCE

--After the wall and furniture are moved off, the lights flash on and very repetitive, beat-focused music starts playing. Students start moving desks onto the stage in rhythm with the beats, giving the whole scene a very robot-like feel.
--Example of music: https://youtu.be/mgBPPL-iNTw
--The front of the room has a board and a teacher's desk. The teacher's desk has the scantrons, packets, and a tissue box.
--After all the desks are in place, the students move up to the front of the room and grab a scantron and packet from the teacher's desk. The teacher is standing behind this desk. After that they sit down behind their desk, with their scantron, packet, and pencil in the exact same formation. At this point their bodies are still somewhat random - some are looking at the board, some are putting away their phones.
T: OK everyone, you know the drill. Today we're studying your knowledge of ZORG, the language of our alien friends. I'll put some words on the board, and you have to match them to the ones in your packet. Any questions?
Some student: Can I use the restroom?
T: No. Let's get started - I'll keep the time on the board.

--Feel of scene: https://youtu.be/EdwSmmXU6JM?t=57
--The teacher starts writing nonsensical words on the board, and everyone starts scribbling in a very systematic, robot-like way. The scribbling cycle follows the eerie music: everyone spends the same amount of time looking in their packet, writing in their packet, and then writing on their scantron.
--Suddenly, someone needs to blow their nose. Unfortunately, the desks are arranged in such a tight way that they inadvertently end up messing up the whole system and making a huge amount of noise while getting up. No-one reacts to this. This students grabs one little tissue, and then makes their way back to their desk, and blows their nose. Then the scene reverts to what it was before.

--During this entire time, the teacher writes times and erases them: 60 minutes, 45 minutes, 30 minutes. As the time nears 0 the music grows more and more intense. At a certain point one of the students grabs their hand, shrieks, and runs off stage. Finally, when the time reaches 0, the eerie music is replaced by something cheerful. Everyone gets up, pushes all the desks around, deposit their sheets, and leave the stage. Only Mary and Stephan remain.

M: That was fun. I love school!
S: Yeah, I struggled especially
M: Sorry, but discussing the test would be considered cheating.
--Stephan looks dumbfounded
M: Just kidding!
--Stephan laughs and gives Mary a high-five. They lock eyes for a moment, and then part ways.


### Scene 9
--Mary and Stephan enter from one side, holding hands, and slowly make their way towards the center.

M: Ugh, we've been walking for such a long time! Where is this place you wanted to show me?
S: Wow, so you have enough patience to take a standardized test but not to walk 10 minutes? It's just around the corner.
--When they reach the center, they "turn around the corner" and the curtains open up to reveal a dark "sky" with little stars hanging up from the catwalk.
S: That, my dear Mary, is the milky way. Hard to believe it, huh?
--Mary is speechless. Sad music begins to play.
--Example of music: https://youtu.be/PYa7XmutCIU or maybe Beach House or some Miyazaki soundtrack
S: Life nowadays is like a never-ending roller-coaster. It's so easy to get caught up in everything.....but I feel like sometimes it's worth just taking a step back.
--Mary hugs Stephan, and they stare at the sky as the stars gently move. The curtains close as the song ends.


### The end!
--The music changes to something more festive, and the curtains open up onto a bright-lit scene. Everyone comes on stage and bows, yada yada.
