# My world

Z = lead
X = startup CEO


## "The Classroom"
*Dark, hazy room*

### SCENE 1
*Students sit in darkness around in an oval formation. Their phones cast a white glare on their faces.*

Hi... I know I'm new here, but I thought that I'd still be able to-

*Someone runs up and hands Z a phone. Stunned and a little scared, Z looks into it. The moment Z does that, a loud stream of noice erupts from the speakers. This noise is a combination of "social media sounds" (a like, a tweet, etc), and pleasant sounds from commercials (a pepsi can opening, a party, etc).*

*Scared even more, Z quickly put the phone down, look around, and cautiously pick it back up. The noise erupts once more. Z look of disappointment washes over Z's face, and Z exits.*

### SCENE 2
*Z emerges from the same side as scene 1. Pairs of students start yelling numbers in ascending order - 6, 20, 100. Finally, two students yell out 300, jump up, hug, and go back to their place.*

*Z recognizes one of the 300 students (S1), and walks towards them a little bit.*
Oh! I think I remember you - we took dance classes together when we were children. I...-

*S1 looks weirded out, and steps away. As Z walks around, all the students move away and make way for Z.*

### SCENE 3
*Students move into a line, and hold on to a train car railing (several are sitting). Once in a while they all wobble, making the new setting seem more real. Once in a while, several students laugh or smile at the same time.* *Z emerges from the same side, and sits down to one of the students.*
Cold, isn't it? Almost seems like we live in a tundra, or something.


## "The Office"
*Sun-lit, high pressure startup office*

### SCENE 1
*X enters like a proud peacock to a panel of VCs.*
Users, engagement, and profit - that's what we're all about! Over the last trimester Click Co has grown 300% - our user base is up to a record high of 3 Million, and our profits have followed suit. 2019 is shaping up to be the most profitable fiscal year on record!
*VCs politely clap. One investor (VC1) raises their hand.*
What about the audience demographic?
